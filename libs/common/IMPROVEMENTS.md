- `RequestSizeMiddleware` - Payload size limiting

## üîß **Architecture Improvements**

### **Better Organization**

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ decorators/          # Custom decorators (validation, caching)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dtos/               # Enhanced DTOs with advanced features
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ exceptions/         # Structured exception hierarchy
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ filters/            # Global exception handling
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ interceptors/       # Response transformation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ middleware/         # Request/response middleware
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types/              # Advanced TypeScript types
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/              # Comprehensive utility functions
```

### **Type Safety**

- All utilities are fully typed with TypeScript
- Generic types for reusable components
- Strict typing for configuration and database operations

### **Error Handling Strategy**

- Hierarchical exception structure
- Correlation ID tracking across requests
- Structured error responses
- Appropriate logging levels

### **Performance Considerations**

- Built-in caching mechanisms
- Memory usage monitoring
- Batch processing capabilities
- Rate limiting implementation

## üöÄ **Key Benefits**

### **For Developers**

- **Reduced Boilerplate**: Common patterns are abstracted into reusable utilities
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with comprehensive typing
- **Consistency**: Standardized approaches across the application
- **Developer Experience**: Well-documented utilities with examples

### **For Applications**

- **Security**: Built-in security best practices and utilities
- **Performance**: Optimized utilities with caching and monitoring
- **Reliability**: Robust error handling and health monitoring
- **Maintainability**: Clean, organized code structure

### **For Operations**

- **Observability**: Request tracing and comprehensive logging
- **Monitoring**: Health checks and performance metrics
- **Security**: Security headers and rate limiting
- **Debugging**: Correlation IDs and structured error reporting

## üìù **Migration Notes**

### **Backward Compatibility**

- All existing exports are preserved
- No breaking changes to current functionality
- New features are additive

### **Recommended Adoption**

1. Start using `GlobalExceptionFilter` for centralized error handling
2. Implement `ResponseInterceptor` for consistent API responses
3. Use new validation decorators for enhanced input validation
4. Apply security middleware for improved application security
5. Leverage health check utilities for monitoring

### **Configuration Requirements**

Some utilities may require additional environment variables:

- `JWT_SECRET` for token utilities
- `REDIS_URL` for caching (if using Redis)
- `DATABASE_URL` for database utilities

## üéì **Best Practices Enforced**

1. **Security First**: All utilities follow security best practices
2. **Performance Aware**: Built-in performance monitoring and optimization
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with proper logging
4. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support throughout
5. **Testability**: Utilities designed for easy unit testing
6. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation and examples

## üîÑ **Future Enhancements**

The library architecture supports easy extension for:
